# Target-myRetail-RESTful-service

A case study challenge for Target's hiring process. The task is to build a CRUD API for a mock retail chain.

## How to set up project

The first step to setting up this project locally on your machine is to have Node.js installed. Visit [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to download it for any OS.

Once you have Node.js installed, open up your terminal and run the following command to install all dependencies:

`npm install`

Now, to run the API, run the following command in your terminal:

`npm start`

You should now have the API running on localhost 3000.

**Note**: _You need to set up environment variables -- which are sort of like private keys -- in order for this project to work properly. For instance, you won't be able to connect to the database without them. Ask me for them and I will be happy to provide them for you._
